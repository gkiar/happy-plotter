# Happy Plotter
You're a wizard, `[insert name nere]`! A thumpin' good one, I'd wager. Once you're trained up a bit...

Anyone who's made beautiful plots for publications, infographics, or even just for fun, knows that they aren't always easy or intuitive. If you're anything like me, then your Google history has been riddled with the same queries over and over with several month gaps separating them, all because you forget what that Jupyter widget was called or can't seem to figure out that darn 3D plotting in R.

Well, lucky for you (and future me), here lives code that will help you make beautiful plots, hopefully without as much of the pain.
